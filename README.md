# Walkman

A few lines of Python to get copies of audio files from Plex playlists to add to a walkman.

# Dependencies

Uses `plexapi` module

# Installation 

`git clone https://github.com/veebch/walkman
cd walkman `

Add your plex token (and adjust the hostname if needed)

# Run 

`python3 walkman.py`

The files that make up the playlists should now each be in a separate directory.
